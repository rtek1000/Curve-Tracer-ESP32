# Curve-Tracer-ESP32
Fault locator for electronic circuits, comparing V.I. curves (voltage and current)

Operation based on this project: [Curve Tracer ATmega328](https://github.com/rtek1000/Curve-Tracer-ATmega328)

------------

Note: Work in progress, just demonstrative, not functional, sorry.

### Software

- Visual interface via browser (HTML page)
- IP address location via mDNS ([esp32ct.local](http://esp32ct.local/))
- Automatic/Manual test path selection
- Multiple test impedances (x1, x2, x4, x8)

HTML page (ESP32 Webserver, http://esp32ct.local/):

### Hardware

- Total 160 test tracks for each channel (Ch1: 160 probes, Ch2: 160 probes)
- Analog output via the ESP32's internal DAC

Upload procedure:
- Select "ESP32 Dev Module" board
- Select the "Erase All Flash Before Sketch Upload" (ENABLED) option
- Click the "Sketch (Menu)">""Upload (Ctrl+U)" button
- Click the "Tools (Menu)">"Esp32 Sketch Data Upload" button

WiFi network configuration:
- Log into the "AutoConnectAP" network, password is "password" (Active time is only 30 seconds)
- Open IP "192.168.4.1" (http://192.168.4.1) in internet browser (Do not use https://)
- Click "Configure WiFi" button
- Select your existing WiFi network
- Enter your WiFi network password
- Click the "Save" button
- Wait a while for the ESP32 to restart and log into the network, this can be monitored in the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE "Tools (Menu)">"Serial Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+M)"
- Open "esp32ct.local" (http://esp32ct.local) address in internet browser. You can use the IP address entered in the Serial Monitor, or in an IP locator with mDNS support (Mobile devices may need an [IP locator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdns_discovery.app&hl=en&gl=US) with mDNS support)
