# Curve-Tracer-ESP32
Fault locator for electronic circuits, comparing V.I. curves (voltage and current)

Operation based on this project: [Curve Tracer ATmega328](https://github.com/rtek1000/Curve-Tracer-ATmega328)

------------

Note: Work in progress, just demonstrative, not functional, sorry.

### Software

- Visual interface via browser (HTML page)
- IP address location via mDNS ([esp32ct.local](http://esp32ct.local/))
- Automatic/Manual test path selection
- Multiple test impedances (x1, x2, x4, x8)
